# Meta Quest 2 Quick Start Guide

## Getting a good fit

* Adjust the lenses on the inside of the headset by shifting them left/right until they click into a position which allows you to see most clearly.
* Adjust the straps so they are comfortable for your head.
* If you wear glasses, ensure that you have inserted the glasses spacer.

## Setting the virtual boundary

When you first turn on the headset you will be prompted to set a boundary.

If you are not prompted, you can set one manually:

* Press the oculus button ![Quest button](assets/quest-button.png) on the right controller to open the universal menu.
* Hover over the clock on the left hand side of the menu and open **Quick settings**
* Select **Boundary**
* Follow the onscreen instructions to set the boundary.

In most cases you will be using a **stationary** boundary which is for using the headset whilst sitting or standing in place.

You can also configure a **roomscale** boundary for using the headset while moving around inside a play space.
